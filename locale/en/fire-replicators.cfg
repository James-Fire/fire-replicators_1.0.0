[mod-setting-description]
replstats-speed-factor=This is multiplied with each tier increase, resulting in geometric growth.  Note that changing the time per item while not changing the energy per time will change the energy per item.
replstats-energy-factor=This is multiplied with each tier increase, resulting in geometric growth.
replstats-pollution-factor=This is multiplied with each tier increase, resulting in geometric growth.
replstats-size-base=This value is rounded down to an integer after addition is performed.  If the resulting size would be negative then a size of 1 is used instead.
replstats-size-addend=This is added with each tier increase, resulting in linear growth (or shrinkage, if you think technology should become smaller as it gets more advanced).
replstats-modules-base=This value is rounded down to an integer after addition is performed.  This is how the default numbers of module slots are 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3.  If the resulting number of module slots would be negative then the replicator has no module slots instead.
replstats-modules-addend=This is added with each tier increase, resulting in linear growth.

replresearch-item-multiplier=This is the base number of reps for researching the replication of a new item.  This value is multiplied by the replication tier and may be further modified by that item's category.  Also, because tiers 1 and 5 only require a single item per tier rather than two their number of required reps is multiplied by 2 again.
replresearch-tier-multiplier=This is the base number of reps for researching a new tier of replication.  This value is multiplied by the replication tier.  Also, because tiers 1 and 5 only require a single item per tier rather than two their number of required reps is multiplied by 2 again.

replication-penalty=This value is added to the cost of every replication after everything else is calculated.  It's meant to stop replicating large number of cheap items such are ores or plates from being overpowered.
replication-fluid-quantity=This is the amount of fluid created every time a fluid is replicated.

[item-description]
dark-matter-scoop=Normally dark matter passes through all other matter, interacting only through gravity.  However, this planet contains clusters of an unusual type of crystal.  When an electric current is run through this type of crystal, it physically interacts with an unseen substance that is currently theorized to be dark matter.  Furthermore, when enough electricity is run through an arrangement of these crystals some this dark matter can changed into regular matter.  This substance has been named tenemut, based on the Latin words for dark (tenebris) and change (mutatio).  With additional research it should become possible to choose what substances are produced by this process.
dark-matter-transducer=Dark matter scoops do a good enough job of transforming dark matter into normal matter, if you don't particularly care what your new matter consists of.  Of course, replication which uses scoops alone is rather limited.  More advanced replication will require some form of quality control.  Given the details of the replication process, an extra component which moves the dark matter as it becomes normal matter should do the trick.
matter-conduit=While it is theoretically possible to replicate any substance using just dark matter scoops and transducers, controlling the resulting shapes of those substances is difficult.  This is a problem when trying to replicate technology because many technological devices have very small components.  For example, the integrated circuits used in computers can be mere nanometers across.  The solution to this problem is to invent a new component which can interact with the partially transformed dark matter so that all of the replicated substances form in just the right place.

replicator-1=Uses large amounts of electricity to convert dark matter into matter.  Can only replicate materials which have a high margin of error in their composition and cannot replicate anything with a specific shape.
replicator-2=Uses large amounts of electricity to convert dark matter into matter.  Can replicate pure elements and can form its products into solid shapes.
replicator-3=Uses large amounts of electricity to convert dark matter into matter.  Can replicate chemical substances but has trouble replicating devices due to limited precision when shaping its products.
replicator-4=Uses large amounts of electricity to convert dark matter into matter.  Can replicate complex machines with a high level of detail.
replicator-5=Uses large amounts of electricity to convert dark matter into matter.  Can replicate anything that can possibly be replicated.
